I have been trying to keep some sort of logical order in talking about my life in Japan, but that has made it difficult to talk about things happening now because I want to give the full background to the story. But I want to share something I am really happy about so the background will have to be filled in at a later time.

On Thursday, I managed to get my "MT" licence. 

Before coming to Japan, I had no driving licence. Living in Amami was extremely difficult without being able to drive so last year I took the fairly exacting series of exams necessary to obtain a Japanese driving licence. That is very much a story for another time.

Most cars in Japan are automatic, or "AT" as it says on the licence. Obtaining an AT licence is very much easier than obtaining an MT so that is what I did. However, we also have the use of one or two trucks of the kind extremely popular in rural Japan. I seem most of my neighbours driving these around at least somet of the time. This is not an affectation. Most of us have bulky items to move around quite a bit of the time. In our case it is mostly building materials for the rennovation and construction of houses.

Being able to drive the trucks would be really useful, but they are manual or "MT" as it says on the licence. In Japanese ミッション車 "misshonsha" - "misshon" being for manual transmission. So earlier this year I set about the process of converting my AT licence to an MT known as AT限定解除 (AT genteikaijo, or literally "AT cancellation").

My first hurdle was the Prefectural nature of Japanese driving licences. Mine was issued in what is strictly speaking my home prefecture of Kagawa. That would mean I could not take an MT test here in Amami which is in Kagoshima Prefecture. The solution was easier than I thought. I had just received an Amazon order with my Amami address written on a large box. I took the box and handed it over at the police station in Naze. The staff were amused, but used that address to alter my driving licence.

I was then able to go back to Tatsugo Driving School, where I had studied for my driving licence. They are family run and very laid back. You pay a lump sum to pass a test and then study with them as much as you are able, and they feel you need, until you do. You do not pay per lesson. 

The teaching at the school is rather good. Their teachers were much better at explaining to me what to do than my experience of driving instructors in England, despite the language barrier. 

I will leave details of the course, the teaching and so on for when I write about my first driving lesson experience, but the driving test is quite interesting in its own right.
