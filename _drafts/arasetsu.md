Akina is two villages over. It is larger and more spread out than En and was historically the wealthiest village on the area. Whereas in En there is only just enough space for the village with a few small tankan plantations to fit between the mountains and the sea, Akina has quite a large open area for farming. There are even wet rice fields, which is unusual for Amami as a whole.

On Monday, the 9th of September by our calendar, but the 7th of August by the lunar calendar, it was "arestsu" ("new life), a day for marking the end of Summer and the start of Autumn. I had heard that in Akina, they hold an event called "shochogama" in which they construct a traditional lean-to shelter over night and then at dawn, the men of the village knock it down. I was intrigued to see what it would be like. Friends in Akina told us where to go and, more importantly, when to arrive.

We set off at 5:30 in the morning, but found the main community centre car park in Akina already filling up. Despite its size, Akina is usually pretty quiet, but the roads on the way to the site were bustling with people. My impression of shochogama is that although it is a ritual invocation of rice spirits as a form of harvest festival, people participate for fun in much the same way non-Christians enjoy Christmas. Still if felt ironic that shochogama takes place on hill just next to Akina's church.

We went up the hill to get close to the hut. I had a vague idea I would try an inexpert video of the event to share with you, despite the day starting with pouring rain. In a sense, the event had already begun because we could hear a priest and a number of other men signing from on top of the hut. I think we had the impression that the more exicting - and hence videoable - part would have started rather earlier, so there was a lot of standing around.

At this point there was a call for more men to go and stand on the roof. I got the impression that a lot more weight was needed to get the building to fall down. Some men answered the call, but I was a little hesitant. I had no idea what would happen and normally you would not deliberately stand on top of a building that you knew was going to collapse. In the end, curiousity overcame my hesitation. I gave up the idea of making a video and headed for the roof.

Besides, if I am going to make this place my home, I should try to fit in, shouldn't I?

The roof was made of straw. There were a couple of large ropes to help stabilise the roof and a few smaller ones that some people were holding on to. One of the organisers explained that, tempting though it might be to hold on to a large rope, the idea was that they would snap or be cut as the roof fell down. Holding one might not be all that safe.

So, increasing numbers of us stood and waited. The roof was steep so you had to brace yourself on one back foot and lean slightly forward to avoid falling over. It looked like people had come from all over Amami to take part. I saw a few people in Japan Defence
