Over the last week or so I started seeing lots of bightly coloured decorations made of paper or glistening metal streaming down from trees or hung on or inside buildings. These are for a festival known as "tanabata". Wikipedia gives me lots of information about the festival, but I unsure how much of that applies locally. Certainly it seems to include writing your wishes on pieces of paper and hanging them, ideally on bamboo.

It is associated with a beautiful story ["The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cowherd_and_the_Weaver_Girl) where two lovers, represented by ALtair and Vega, are separated by the Milky Way and unable to meet except once a year at Tanabata. Its history seems to be more complicated than that, but for practical purposes it is bound up with the festival of Obon which, at least in Amami, follows immediately afterwards.

Obon is an important festival in which one honours the spirits of one's ancestors. The "O" is the usual Japanese honorific, so you sometimes hear it called just Bon. It is the day in the year particularly dedicated to honouring the spirit of one's ancestors.

People travel back to their family or ancestral graves for the purpose. En started filling up with people, including grandchildren of residents, who I would see playing on the beach, swimming in the sea, or running around the streets. I imagine it is like my childhood experience of going to stay with my grandparents on [Seil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seil) in Scotland. While to a young adult I suspect En might seem rather dull, to a small child it is probably exciting and full of mystery and possibilities.
