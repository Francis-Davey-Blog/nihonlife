Japan has a reputation for having a friendly police force having a good relationship with the community in which it serves. As with anything, people's experience will vary. I am sure that police in big cities like Tokyo have a completely different set of challenges to those in more rural parts of Japan, and how they conduct themselves will differ. A visit from the local police officer prompted me to share my own experience.
