For more than half a century, I rarely travelled beyond the shores of Great Britain, and had no experience of living outside my home culture. Now I find myself settled in Japan. The experience has been interesting. Perhaps I can share some of it with you. Life being what it is, I will not be posting regularly and may mix stories from early in my time here with the day's events.
