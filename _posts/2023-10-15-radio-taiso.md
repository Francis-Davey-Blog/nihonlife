My home back in Ayagawa is surrounded by fields in which people are busy at work as soon as the Sun rises. Many of my immediate neighbours rise early for much the same reason, but they have different fields to get busy in; necessitating the driving off in little white trucks which are the signature of the Japanese countryside. So, I found myself getting up at sunrise and then going for a walk, or heading to my favourite public bath to start the day.
Something I noticed was groups of people gathering in small parks and around community centres. Later I discovered that they were getting together to take part in ラジオ体操 (*rajio taisou* - literally "health radio")
