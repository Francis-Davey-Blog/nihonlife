Last night the village, or most of it, was up until the early hours of the morning. What we were up to is something I will leave for a later post, but it did make me wonder whit this morning, of all mornings, there might be a change to routine. 

For every morning since I have come here, 6:30am is time for Radio Taiso.  *Rajio taisou* (ラジオ体操) literally means "health radio". It is a series of simple physical exercises broadcast on NHK radio (the Japanese equivalent of the BBC). It actually dates back to 1928, but was suspended for a while by the occupying American forces after the war, perhaps because it felt a bit too military. But it came back in a renewed form in 1951 and has remained roughly the same ever since.

I had first encountered it during early morning walks in Kagawa. I would sometimes see groups of people gathering outside community centres or in public parks. I learned that they would switch on a radio and do the exercises as a group. Later, I read that practice varies across Japan. Some municipalities restrict the kinds of noise you can make early in the morning, so any unofficial group must take care I suppose.

But En is enthusiastically communitarian village. It has a public broadcast system, and over that system Radio Taiso is broadcast every morning. A small number of people gather outside the community centre to do the exercises. I have spotted others doing it outside their homes in the street and I suspect there are others who do it in the privacy - and now Winter is coming on the warmth - of their homes.

I eventually plucked up the courage (and energy) to go to the community centre. There a local resident who is in charge of the broadcasts welcomed me and I learned the moves by shadowing her. I suspect there are times when she does the exercises on her own because sometimes there we are the only other people with her. But sometimes there are more. I found it a useful way to get introduced to some of the villagers.

In the Summer holidays, the younger children had "stamp cards" to be stamped for doing particular activities. They could get stamps for coming to Radio Taiso every day for a week. When asked what they would get for filling in all the stamps, we were told *homeru* (someone would praise them), so I guess that the stamps are a little like the gold stars given by my primary school teachers in my youth.

The broadcast currently has two announcers. They usually start by encouraging you to do a specific exercise - a hand or foot movement for example. They then play the "Radio Taiso Song". There are many versions online, but I found [one on youtube](https://youtu.be/mrfRh64v5r8) which gives a feel for the instruments and sound quality of the broadcast version. I am not sure if one is supposed to sing along, although the lady who manages the village broadcast usually does. 

The lyrics are  
新しい朝が来た　希望の朝だ  
喜びに胸を開け　大空あおげ  
ラジオの声に　健(すこ)やかな胸を  
この香る風に　開けよ  
それ　一　二　三
