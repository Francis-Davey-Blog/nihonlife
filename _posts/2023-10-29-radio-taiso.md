Last night the village, or most of it, was up until the early hours of the morning. What we were up to is something I will leave for a later post, but it did make me wonder whit this morning, of all mornings, there might be a change to routine. 

For every morning since I have come here, 6:30am is time for Radio Taiso.  *Rajio taisou* (ラジオ体操) literally means "health radio". It is a series of simple physical exercises broadcast on NHK radio (the Japanese equivalent of the BBC). It actually dates back to 1928, but was suspended for a while by the occupying American forces after the war, perhaps because it felt a bit too military. But it came back in a renewed form in 1951 and has remained roughly the same ever since.

I had first encountered it during early morning walks in Kagawa. I would sometimes see groups of people gathering outside community centres or in public parks. I learned that they would switch on a radio and do the exercises as a group. Later, I read that practice varies across Japan. Some municipalities restrict the kinds of noise you can make early in the morning, so any unofficial group must take care I suppose.

But En is enthusiastically communitarian village. It has a public broadcast system, and over that system Radio Taiso is broadcast every morning. A small number of people gather outside the community centre to do the exercises. I have spotted others doing it outside their homes in the street and I suspect there are others who do it in the privacy - and now Winter is coming on the warmth - of their homes.
