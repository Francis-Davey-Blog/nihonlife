On the North coast of the island of Amami Oshima, facing out to the East China Sea is the small village of En. Since this is where I am likely to be living for a little while, it deserves an introduction.

En's inhabitants or "Encchu" (えんっちゅ if you can read hiragana) in the local language, seem pretty clear that their village is called "En", but many islanders seem to think otherwise as witness today's conversation on the bus:

> Driver (to me): *doko made* \[where to?\]
> Me: *En*
> Driver: *Yen*?
> Me: *Hai*

En is written 円.
