On the North coast of the island of Amami Oshima, facing out to the East China Sea is the small village of En. Since this is where I am likely to be living for a little while, it deserves an introduction.

En's inhabitants or "Encchu" (えんっちゅ if you can read hiragana) in the local language, seem pretty clear that their village is called "En", but many islanders seem to think otherwise as witness today's conversation on the bus:

> Driver (to me): *doko made* \[where to?\]
> Me: *En*
> Driver: *Yen*?
> Me: *Hai*

Something I had not appreciated before coming to Japan, is that the currency we call the "yen", with the international symbol ￥ is here pronounced "en" and written using the kanji 円, which descends by simplificatoin from an old Chinese character 圓 representing something circular in shape and, presumably because coins were also circular, currency. 

If you are a keen science fiction fan, or have an interest in ships of the world, you may also recognise that 円 is used on many Japanese ships, though this time pronounced "maru". As fans will recall, *Kobayashi Maru* situation was a no-win scenario designed by Starfleet to test its cadest. Captain James T. Kirk being the only person to have successfully completed it, albeit by cheating.

Wikipedia suggests to me that the pronunciation "yen" was an older form of "en" which we borrowed into English and never updated to track modern Japanese speech. But whether that has anything at all to do with En's name, or why En is called that at all, is beyond me at the moment. En is one of those places that has escaped the notice of the powerful and little seems to be written about it. I am left to asking questions about it my rudimentary Japanese, or hearing what other islanders have to say about it.

En is small and compact. It is said the houses are so close together you know what your neighbours are having for dinner. Compact, not just because there is little space between the sea and the mountains, but because outside the village lives the *habu*, the most dangerous snake in Japan. Habu are found only in a a few islands from here to Okinawa. They are quite aggressive and venomous. Keeping an area clear of undergrowth is essential if you want to avoid the possibility of running into a habu and then a quick visit to a hospital.

En's main claim to fame is the Kaganbana tunnel through which you can see the Sun set at the right day in Septemeber. At other times it still makes a beautiful picture at sunset. People often come to photograph themselves or their families against the
